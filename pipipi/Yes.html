        <h2>I'm really sorry for what I said, it was not appropiate, and I shouldn't be joking with stuff like since it is a really serious topic. I really don't think before I say stuff so I can be really mean wihtout meaning too. I'm really really sorry and I hope you can forgive because I really appreciate our friendship and I don't want it to be ruin. Again I'm really sorry if I really offended you, and I would try to think more the stuff I say before I say it. Sorry :( </h2>
